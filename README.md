## Common issues ##
#### If no popups appear: ####
*The universal problemsolver list*
- Did you remember to enable the service by pressing the "Enable/disable" button and then setting Notifly to ON in the next screen?
- Make sure the service actually is running. Does it show up under System Settings > Apps > Running?
- If not, reboot the phone. Does that help?
- [4.2 and earlier] Do you have any other accessibility services running? Some other services, like Pushbullet, blocks Notifly from reading notifications.
- Uninstall the app completely, reboot the phone, and install it again. Make sure you are using the [latest version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notifications.screen). After enabling the service inside the app, reboot the phone.
- Allow more priority levels in the settings.
- Some phones block Notifly from displaying popups. Check that "draw on top" or "display popups" is enabled in System Settings > Apps > Notifly.

#### XIAOMI, ZTE and MIUI users: ####
Before you can use this app, you'll probably need to give it some slack when it comes to security.

1. Go to System Settings > All > Apps > Downloaded > Notifly notifications.
2. Toggle the switch that says 'Show popup windows' (second option).
3. At the bottom, go to 'Manage permissions'.
4. Set 'I trust this app' to on.

*It might also be necessary to reset the app data/settings.*

#### Huawei users: ####
*While I don't have any Huawei devices to test this with, a user said the following works on Huawei Ascend P7:*

Open the app 'phone manager', click settings in the top right corner. Select "dropzone management" and give the app permission.

If this doesn't work, try the instructions for XIAOMI/ZTE/MIUI users.

#### Lollipop users: ####
A fix for the "Don't disturb" and "Block current app" features is on its way.

#### Uninstalling: ####
If you find that the uninstall button is disabled, go to Settings > Security > Device administrators > Notifly, and tap Disable.
